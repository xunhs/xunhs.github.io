> 论文审阅过程中，与reviewers答辩常用句型句式整理。
<!--more-->


### 审评中常出现的词组：
state of art (SoA)  该课题的国内外研究现状

respecting the comments of the referee  作为对同审的回应


In response to the comment 作为对评审意见的响应

To the best of the authors' knowledge 据我们所知


### 论辩意见：
学术论文的写作本身就是在批评与修改中提高，且这一过程并非一帆风顺，当有评审者对你的研究成果持怀疑甚至否定态度时，并不意味着该研究成果毫无价值。但是，我们需要正面且详细地回复这类评审意见。刻意回避负面的评审意见会使编辑认为论文确实有不足之处。

**答复信一般可由三部分组成：对编辑和评审者处理论文表示感谢；对答复和修改进行概要性的说明；针对每一位评审者进行一一对应的答复。**


### 功能句式整理

#### 致谢
- We (the authors) sincerely thank Referee 1 for the time and effort given to our manuscript and raising such a constructive suggestion. 

- We thank **again** the referee for raising such a constructive suggestion.

- We thank again the referee for his/her frank recognition given to our manuscript, in addition to his/her time and effort spent in reviewing our manuscript.

- We thank the referee for raising such a suggestion which improves further the presentation and quality of the manuscript.

- We also thank the referee sincerely for the inspirations from the comment.

- Thank the referee sincerely for the important discussions, which have greatly imporved the quality of our manuscript.

#### 添加内容


Respecting the comments of the referee, the following Remark 1 has been added in the revised manuscript.

**Remark 1.** "*The general procedure of the discre...*" 

As suggested, the formulations of such seven discrete-time models are listed in Table 3 of the Revision Information letter (i.e., Table 1 of the revised manuscript).

#### 删除

As suggested by referee, the revised manuscript has been shortened from 15 pages to 13 pages; specifically speaking, similar figures associated with Example 1 have been omitted, and some expressions or statements for constructing the discrete-time ZNN models and GNN model have been simplified.


#### 更新

##### 更新内容

**We have updated** the literature survey **in the new manuscript according to the suggestion of the editor**. Specifically, nine recent related papers from ITS (i.e., references [4] through [6], [10] through [15] in the new manuscript) have been added in Introduction, and reference [6] in original manuscript has been removed (in the new manuscript).

##### 修改图片/图表:
As suggested, the corresponding Fig.13 and 14 have been revised according to the format of Figs.1.



##### 列举修改

The formulations of other multiple-poiunt discrete-time ZNN-K nideks by exploiting diffenrent multiple-point numerical differentiation formulas, torgether with that of the ZNN-L model, are listed in Table 1 of the Revision Information letter (i.e., Table 4 in the revised manuscript) for readers' convenience. Note that ...

In response to the comment, some challenges of developing the discrete-time Zhang neural networks for the time-varying problems solving are listed as follows.

1) In the solving process of time-varying problems...

2) In the solving process of time-varying problems...


Two example of time-varying quadratic minimization in the original manuscript are investigated and illustrated, which substantiate well the effectiveness of the proposed methods/models.



#### 陈述观点

- 据我们所知，目前没有: **To the best of the authors' knowledge**, there is almost no literature dealing with time-varying quadratic minimization via discrete-time neural networks **at present stage**.

- reviewer是不是误解我们的表述了: After reading the referee's comments, we think that the referee may have **misunderstood** the essence of the time-varying problems solving, and we want to address the concern as follows.

- 简单明了是最好的: In the authors' opinion, **simplicity is beauty**. As Occam's razor suggests, when we have two competing theories that achieve the same efficacy, the simpler one is the better. Therefore, being simple, direct and straightforward is actually the advantage of this work on the condition of achieving excellent results, and it is thus easy for readers to understand and use the discrete-time ZNN models proposed in the manuscript.

- 希望上述的解释能够让您满意: **In summary, we sincerely hope that the above explanations can help the referee understand better** the time-varying problems solving. **We also thank the referee sincerely for the inspirations from the comment.**

- 希望上述解释能够消除您的顾虑: Finally, **we hope that our response can address the referee' concerns**. 
- 如果您能直接告诉我们，请您直说吧
  - In addition, if he/she has other better specific discretization methods, **please feel free to tell us to try**. **This may be another good direction for us to extend the research. **
  - It will be much helpful if the referee can **directly tell us** the existing state of arts of conversion of a continuous-time system that he/she thinks. Respecting the comments of the referee, the multiple-point numerical differentiation formulas [40], [41] are investigated further to convert the continuous-time ZNN model to discrete-time ZNN models, which has been added in the revised manuscript, i.e., the Appendix.


### 答复模板
答复1:We/The authors thank the editor very much for giving us such inspiring advice. 【开头感谢】

We have **updated** the literature survey  in the new manuscript according to the suggestion of the editor. 【我们做的修改】【引用方面的修改（添加，删除引用）】

 Specifically, nine recent related papers from ITS (i.e., references [4] through [6], [10] through [15] in the new manuscript) have been added in Introduction, and reference [6] in original manuscript has been removed (in the new manuscript).【说明具体修改】

 Finally, the authors would like to say thanks again sincerely to the editor for his time and effort spent in reviewing the manuscript, as well as many constructive comments which have imporved much further the presentation and quality of this manuscript.【结尾感谢】

答复2:First of all, we (the authors) would like to express our sincere gratitude to the editors and anonymous referees for their time, effort  and recognition given to our manuscript ITS-0491. Specifically, "*The problem studied in the paper is ****very interesting****...* " (Referee 1); "*In my opinion, the work is ****good ****and the contribution of the paper is ****significant***"  (Referee 2).

【首先感谢review的评论，并列举评论的话】

Secondly, we gratefully point out that the editors' and referees' comments and suggestions have really constructively helped us improve further the quality and presentation of this manuscript. In light of such inspiring comments and suggestions, we have revised the original manuscript duly and carefully, with main revisions listed as follows.

1)  As the response to the comments of Referee 1, the multiple-point numerical differentiation formulas (given by newly-cited references [40], [41] in the revised manuscript) have been investigated to convert the continuous-time system to the discrete-time system (please see the Appendix in the revised manuscript). Moreover, a rebot-manipulator motion planning example (i.e., Example 3) has been added to Section VII for further verifying the effectiveness of the proposed methods/models.

2) As suggested by Referee 2, Remark 1 about the general differences between the continuous-time ZNN model and discrete-time ZNN models has been added to Section III. In addition, newly-cited references [40] through [42] in the revised manuscript are mentionede in Remark 1. Moreover, Remark 2 about the procedure of the combinede discrete-time ZNN-BFGS method/models for solving the time-varying quadratic-minimization problem has been added to S ection V.

3) As suggested by Referee 4, Figs.13 and 14 have been revised duly according to the format of Figs.1, 4, 5, 6 and 7. In addition, the formulations of the discrete-time ZNN, ZNN-BFGS and GNN models have been listed in Table 1 in Section VII.

Thirdly, with many thanks to the editors and referees, we would like to address their comments as follows. 【再次感谢，并分referee分别回答comments】
