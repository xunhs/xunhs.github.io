   4. Urban AOI **have great meanings in multiple application domains**. **For tourists**, AOI highlight the interesting zones within a city, and can therefore be used to support trip planning of travelers. **For city planners**, AOI reveal the regions which receive high exposure among the general public. Accordingly, these regions could be assigned higher priorities when there are only limited resources **for urban planning projects**, such as city beautification (Espuche et al., 1991, Gandy, 2006). Since AOI are often visited by a large number of people, **transportation analysts** can examine these regions to understand traffic flows and human mobility patterns (Batty, 2007, Yuan and Raubal, 2012). In addition, **information service providers** can display targeted information based on AOI (e.g., highlighting the hotels within the AOI of a city)

    3.  相比于传统研究 The rapid development of location-based services and technologies facilitates the attainment of **big geospatial data** and **provides more accurate, plentiful and effective information of** human interactions in places, **compared with traditional** survey data.
    4.  Determining how green our streets **are has always been difficult given the time and money consumed using conventional methods**.
    5.  问卷调查，采访 Previous studies were conducted by the traditional data collection methods(传统的数据收集方法), such as interviews and questionnaires(问卷调查，采访), which are laborious, costly and time-consuming(费时费力).
    6.  传统方法费时费力，应当出现新的范式来指导 most studies rely on **in-person assessments or field observations** to collect data about built environment characteristics. Such conventional data collection approaches have several challenges, including **high labour intensity, long update period, restriction to small-scale geographic areas, etc.** (Golder and Macy 2011; Seresinhe, Preis, and Moat 2015; Lu 2019). **New paradigms should be proposed** to solve these problems and guide studies on sensing the urban physical environment (Rathore et al. 2016; Janowicz et al. 2019).
    7.  传统方法劣势**详细描述** Traditional studies for environmental health research usually employ self-reports and questionnaires, field surveys, and secondary sources to characterize built environments at element level and at scene level, respectively. Questionnaires and self-reports are arguably the most commonly used sources. With these sources, investigators may ask respondents to evalu- ate different aspects of neighbourhood attributes . For field observations, researchers are asked to record and describe their urban environment audits by walking or driving around the study areas with pre-defined survey forms (Gullón et al. 2015; Lawlor et al. 2003; Takano, Nakamura, and Watanabe 2002). Secondary sources refer to those pre-defined environmental measures based on spatial analysis and modelling such as spatial accessibility measures (Pliakas et al. 2017; Leslie and Cerin 2008). All three approaches have their strengths and limitations. Questionnaires are the most commonly used method. It might be affected by people’s biases while field-audits are more objective. But both methods are costly, labour-intensive and time-consuming when conducting research with a large sample size or over large regions. Secondary sources might not characterize neighbourhoods in sufficient detail, and might be limited to specific types of environmental exposures (Pliakas et al. 2017). - [Yuhao Kang, A review of urban physical environment sensing using street view imagery in public health studies]
    8.  传统调查数据劣势：贵、短时效、不具代表性 Notwithstanding the fact that travel survey or diary data are often sufficient to create a detailed picture of travellers’ socioeconomic characteristics, **the obvious disadvantages of such data** include the **expense** involved in collection, the **inability** of such data to reveal real-time travel behaviour over a long period, and the **small and therefore non-representative nature** of the populations sampled in travel surveys—disadvantages that are particularly problematic for studies of megacities.

11. **Inspired by the evidence that** the urban mobility is highly relevant to urban land use and urban physical environment, our method assumes that the streetscape depicted in street-level imagery reflects urban functions and that urban activities in streets of similar functions present similar temporal patterns.
12. 从这种角度来讲 Compared to other data sources such as land use or land cover data, social sensing data has a great capability for delineating people’s movements（背景）. **In this light**, it is worthwhile using it to improve the accuracy of population estimation, given the fact that using NTL data alone may overestimate population in some specific areas due to excessive high light radiance.

   2. Throughout the paper, we use the **vocabulary** network or CNN to describe a network architecture, such as VGG; and use the vocabulary model to describe a trained network, or a fusion of many trained networks. One specific network may generate many models because it can be trained in different ways. We also use street view, ground view, and ground-level to describe terrestrial images that were taken from ground-level, and aerial view, overhead, and nadir view to describe remote sensing images acquired by airborne or spaceborne sensors.
4. 神经网络模型框架介绍
   1. [如图] The architecture of the proposed 1-d SPP-Net is presented in Fig. 2b. [由几部分组成] The network is composed of three major parts, i.e. five 1-d convolutional layers (each layer is closely followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation), one 1-d SPP layer, and two fully connected layers. [不同层的特点/参数] The convolutional layers use kernel size of 24, 24, 7, 7, and 3, with stride of 1, 24, 1, 7, and 1, and padding of 12, 12, 3, 3, and 1, respectively. The output of the convolutional layers is then fed into the 1-d SPP layer to obtain fixed-length representation, which is further processed by the fully connected layers. The final output 256-d features are exploited as extracted TS features. [不同层的作用] The convolutional layers can extract short-term time-series features, by stacking them, the patterns with long-term dependencies can be captured in higher layers. The 1-d SPP layer and fully connected layers can further aggregate and condense the convolutional features to higher level semantic features.
5. 训练数据配置/ground-truth data

#### 提出倡议

1. To this end, what **we suggest in this study** is that urban planning practices **should attach importance to** "cognitive place" and "cognitive distance", which load human experiences and perceptions toward the environments. This is also coincident with the ultimate goal of urban planning, urban design, and smart-city construction, i.e., making better human societies and improving human lives.

#### Remainder of this paper

1. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 **reviews the related literature** on house price modeling and the understanding of human sense of place with big data and deep learning. In Section 3, we **introduce the proposed framework** of characterizing human settlement from a place perspective and the P-HPM model. In Section 4, we **describe the datasets** used in this research, including online house information, locational amenities, human mobility patterns, and perceptual rating metrics extracted from street-view images. Section 5 **introduces the methods**, including the factor analysis, spatial autoregressive model and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Section 6 **presents the results** of house price prediction in Boston and Los Angeles. We then **discuss broad implications**, policy making takeaways for urban planning, and limitation of this work and suggestions for future work on place-based housing price modeling in Section 7. Finally, we **conclude this work** in Section 8.

2. Introduction 第一段(引入话题,你得说你做的**研究有意义**吧)
   - The mining of information hidden in urban and regional road networks has a longestablished history in the fields of traffic geography, land use planning, and economic geography (Porta et al. 2006). In an era of unprecedented global urbanization, the continuous improvement of the urban road system also sustains immense social mobility pressures (Batty 2008) and plays a vital role in urban development (Wang et al. 2012). As the artificial corridor in the urban landscape, the road network is the framework of urban development and an intrinsic factor of urban space expansion. Hence, the exploration of the road network structure not only helps to interpret the topology of the road network but also contributes to the understanding of the organization and spatial distribution of the urban system (Wang et al. 2011, Levinson and Moreno 2012). 解析：一段一句话，一句话至少一引用；研究话题历史悠久=>目前该话题也是热点=>(路网)的重要角色=>研究(路网)的意义(不但)(而且) (From Yao yao, [https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806]('https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806'))
   - The rapid increase in private car ownership **aggravates** metropolitan traffic congestion, thereby causing a series of issues, such as air pollution, high energy consumption, and accidents (Ding, Wang, Liu, Zhang, & Jiawen Yang, 2017) [私家车保有量的快速增长加剧交通拥堵，同时造成了一系列的问题]. **A possible countermeasure** to alleviate the aforementioned negative impacts is to prioritize public transportation (Chakour & Eluru, 2016) [缓解以上问题一个比较好的策略是提高公共交通的地位。引出自己做的这样研究的意义]. Transit authorities **aim to optimize** public transportation planning and **improve** service quality to achieve the goal of promoting public transit systems, and ultimately, **increase** the attractiveness of public transit [提高公共交通地位的目的旨在...就说它有什么好处嘛]. **In particular, identifying the key determinants** that affect transit ridership and analyzing the spatial and temporal evolution of influences **is crucial** (Taylor & Fink, 2003) [在这其中，识别关键因子尤为重要！引到自己的研究点]. **A thorough understanding of the factors** that influence transit ridership can **enable** transit authorities to efficiently allocate the limited resources for the deployment of transit service and to **develop** additional targeted policies for pricing and investments [继上一句补刀，我们做的这个研究点啊能干嘛。。能干嘛。。].
3. Introduction**方法**引入段（就是说你这篇论文引入了...的方法，经典的三段论
   - Recently, **there has been a surge of interest in** graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) for learning graph-structured data where the range of connection varies (Bruna et al. 2014)该方法目前使用很广泛. To effectively process the connection information, GCNNs generally follow an aggregation scheme where each node aggregates characteristics of its neighbors to learn a deep representation of the contextual information (Defferrard, Bresson, and Vandergheynst 2016).一句话介绍该方法: 是什么、解决什么问题 This powerful technique is able to capture both the longrange and short-range relationships through its neural network weights. Clearly, it is suitable for modeling a graph of connected places.总之，该方法用在解决我们的问题上是适合的(From Di Zhu, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2019.1694403]('https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2019.1694403'))
4. Introduction 讲**数据**
   - 大数据+方法=>新机遇：The emergence of big data and volunteered geographic information (VGI) (Goodchild, 2007), along with state-of-the-art computing and analyzing techniques, provides new opportunities for capturing and depicting human mobility and perceptions of places. 大数据+方法=>新机遇 Various types of data sources have been used in understanding human dynamics. For example, by the utilization of taxi GPS data (Tang et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017), cell phone data (Gao, 2015; Kang et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2019; Ratti et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2015), and geotagged social media posts (Hu & Wang, 2020; Jurdak et al., 2015), researchers are able to capture fine-scale spatiotemporal human movement patterns at different places. Such information contribute to the global sense of place (Bissell, 2021), and can potentially reveal socioeconomic environment, such as land use type (Pei et al., 2014), commuting patterns (Yang et al., 2015), and urban vibrancy (Jia et al., 2019). 很多数据已经被成功应用+举例，得到某种信息/知识，这种信息/知识的作用+举例。 Regarding human perceptions of places, abundant datasets about geo-tagged photos and street-view images, along with advanced machine learning techniques provide opportunities to obtain a more complete view about how people feel about the world through the analysis of their expressions, sentiments and emotions (Hu et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2019), and perceptions from the visual sceneries (Zhang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2014). 这里聚焦到你的研究主题，你要用到的研究数据，这些数据能干啥 The proliferation of the above-mentioned researches reveals the significance of embedding place-based human-environment interactions in solving socioeconomic problems and in planning for livable cities from a combination of humanistic perspective and using computational approaches. 意义 (From https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103333/)
   - Crowdsourced data (such as POIs, check-in data, and taxi trajectory data) collected by various sensors have led the related studies into a new stage. These data sources contain abundant semantic information of human activity patterns and urban land use functions. Researchers have tried various data, such as POIs, mobile phone location records, GPS trajectories, and check-in data, to discover urban functional zones. Since different kinds of data can reflect different characteristics of urban functional zones, it is essential to integrate multi-source data to improve the accuracy of recognition of functional zones. In the literature, DRoF—proposed by Yuan, Zheng, and Xie (2012)—is one of the most representative methods. They used both POIs and GPS trajectories to discover the functions of each region with a topic-based inference model. Similarly, Wang, Gu, Dou, and Qiao (2018) used POIs and trajectory data to recognize urban functional zones based on spatial semantics and interactions between regions. Some researchers also tried to integrated remote sensing images and crowdsourced data (such as POIs and check-in data) to identify the land use functions of fine-grained zones using supervised classification.

5. Introduction 最后一段，概括**总述**
   - **To this end**, we **propose** a conceptual **framework** which characterizes human settlement from a place perspective by **highlighting** people's sense of place and human dynamics. 我们提出一个框架。注意highlight突出/凝练亮点 A place-oriented hedonic pricing **model** (P-HPM) that follows the conceptual framework **is introduced**. The P-HPM **extends** the traditional HPM by involving the notion of place **from two aspects**: human mobilities at places and human perceptions of places. **More specifically**, we take the hourly number of people's visits to a place as a descriptor of human mobilities, and the perceptual rating scores of a place's physical appearance captured in street-view images as a proxy of human perceptions. 模型细节：引入一种模型（此处区分框架和模型的区别）+模型从...方面进行了扩展+具体的实验细节（辅助论述） **The contribution of this research is threefold**: First, <u>we **propose** a conceptual framework</u> for human settlement value assessment <u>from a place perspective</u>, **discuss** how human mobilities and perceptions matter for determining house price modeling. Second, we <u>**introduce** the P-HPM for modeling</u> the house prices not only from static and objective perspectives of a property, but also by formulating dynamic human movement patterns and subjective human perceptions of places based on multi-source big geo-data and advanced machine learning approaches. Third, we **compare** the HPM and P-HPM to explore the impacts of place-related variables to **illustrate** how these determinants affect house prices and their spatial stationarities to the house prices. 凝练本文的贡献，注意这部分和上面框架的论述部分的区别所在 Our research **provides humanistic insights** into integrating place in human settlement value investigation. Such **perspectives may benefit** other fields of study not limited to urban planning, geography, and urban economics. 价值意义所在：本研究提供一种见解+这种见解对...有利 (From https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103333/)
   - This research introduces the use of GCNNs to model connected places where each place is represented as a node, place haracteristics are the node features to be computed, and place connections are represented as the graph edges.本研究引入一种方法去...,这里这个 where 用的很好 The graph convolution can effectively learn from the graph structures and node features to understand the place characteristics in a geographic context.这个方法好啊，能干啥干啥，其实就是上一句分开写，如果太长了看着难受 The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of incorporating place connections to predict place characteristics.本文的目标啊 In a case study of the Beijing metropolitan area, we took advantage of GCNNs in formalizing, reasoning, and understanding places.这里说 case study 在哪里 Three scenarios were designed to consider different connection types. A series of comparative experiments revealed the influence of place connections on predicting place characteristics.陈述对比实验的(From Di Zhu, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2019.1694403]('https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2019.1694403'))
   - In this study, via identified communities in the city road network, we propose a novel way to link the urban roads with the urban space and urban functional zones 先总的说一下，通过什么，这篇文章提出了什么去解决什么样的问题. Specifically, based on the urban road network model constructed with OpenStreetMap road data, the Infomap community detection method is employed to detect the hierarchical communities and analyze their spatial distribution at different levels. In addition, points-of-interest (POI) data and their indicators are used to reveal the land use and functional area density, the mixing degree and the enrichment status of the community-based network, exploring the relations between communities within road network and urban functional zone distributions 从 Specifically 到结尾都是讲，你方法呀的步骤或者框架呀包含哪些部分.(From Yao yao, [https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806]('https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806'))
   - In summary, the four technical issues referred to above are critical to extracting functional zones, but they have yet to be resolved 未解决的问题. This study aims to determine the solutions to the four issues, and extract functional zones from VHR satellite images 本文做了什么. Four contributions are made in this research 总结贡献点: (1) spatial-pattern features characterizing local spatial patterns of objects are proposed and used for functional-zone segmentation; (2) a geoscene segmentation method is first proposed to delineate functional zones at multiple scales; (3) two parameters, i.e., scale and the weight of spatial-pattern features, as well as their impacts on segmentation results are evaluated and reviewed; and (4) the proposed methods are used to map functional zones for three cities and compare their functional structures. The four contributions are novel and crucial to urban functional-zone analysis 这几个贡献对...很重要. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first work on automatic functional-zone segmentation 就我们所知，我们是第一个.

6. 讲研究的**应用**（对于**各行各业的人**都有用，其实比较套话，用的时候**多举例子**，写具体一点，太抽象了难让人信服）
   - Urban AOI **have great meanings in multiple application domains**. **For tourists**, AOI highlight the interesting zones within a city, and can therefore be used to support trip planning of travelers. **For city planners**, AOI reveal the regions which receive high exposure among the general public. Accordingly, these regions could be assigned higher priorities when there are only limited resources **for urban planning projects**, such as city beautification (Espuche et al., 1991, Gandy, 2006). Since AOI are often visited by a large number of people, **transportation analysts** can examine these regions to understand traffic flows and human mobility patterns (Batty, 2007, Yuan and Raubal, 2012). In addition, **information service providers** can display targeted information based on AOI (e.g., highlighting the hotels within the AOI of a city). (From Hu yingjie, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971515300120]('https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971515300120'))
7. 讲数据/方法的优势，适用于该研究
   - Among the many types of social media data, geotagged Flickr photos **possess a high suitability** for exploring urban AOI. **One major advantage** of Flickr data is that they reflect the interest of people towards locations. + (解释) **In addition, the openness** of the Flickr API allows the retrieval of publicly available data throughout the world and since the year of 2004. + (解释) **Besides, existing research** shows that a major proportion of Flickr photos were taken in urban areas, and this gives Flickr data one more advantage for studying urban AOI. + (解释) (From Hu yingjie, Introduction 部分第 5 段， [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971515300120]('https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971515300120')) Finally, instead of focusing on one particular component (e.g., extracting textual tags), we propose a coherent framework **which connects data processing, AOI generating, tag and photo summarizing, and knowledge discovery.**

#### Study Area, Data Description, Method

1. 数据描述
   - 行政区划：The administrative boundary data used in this study was derived from the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM) ([https://www.gadm.org/]('https://www.gadm.org/')). After projection transformation and topology checking, the administrative division data of different scales are used in the preprocessing, calculation and analysis of other experimental data.(From Yao yao, [https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806]('https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806'))
   - OSM： The primary dataset for this study is the road data obtained from OSM, which was acquired in January 2018 ([https://www.openstreetmap.org]('https://www.openstreetmap.org')). OSM is an open source map provider that aims to provide users with free and easily accessible digital map resources (Haklay 2010) and is considered to be the most successful and prevailing volunteered geographic information (VGI) at this stage (Fan et al. 2014). The accuracy of the positioning and the topological relationship of the OSM roads in the study area is exceptionally high (Yao et al. 2018). In addition to the fundamental spatial information such as latitude and longitude, the road data obtained from the OSM contains additional attribute information, including road type, maximum travel speed, and one-way streets, which contribute to preprocessing and establishing the road network. After preprocessing operations, such as simplification, merging, and topology inspection, 81,377 roads and 60,756 nodes were extracted (Figure 2).(From Yao yao, [https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806]('https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806'))
   - 研究城市：Data used in this study have been retrieved using Flickr's public API. Six cities from six different countries have been selected for this work, which are: New York City (NYC), London, Paris, Shanghai, Mumbai, and Dubai. The first three cities are generally recognized as **well-developed cities**, while the second three cities **have experienced fast development** in the past 10 years. We deliberately choose these two groups in order to examine the difference in the growth patterns of their AOI. The data retrieval was performed in July 2014, and we retrieved all publicly available and geotagged Flickr data from June 2004 to June 2014 in order to study the AOI growth patterns in the past 10 years. The data for each city **were retrieved using a bounding box containing the city's administrative boundary.**
   - trajectory：**This dataset contains** 102,361 trips made by 16,887 Mobike users on 79,062 bicycles in August 2016. **Each trip consisted of data fields**, including trip ID, bike ID, user ID, trip start time and end time, longitude and latitude for origin and destination, and GPS tracking along the trajectory. **The spatial resolution of the GPS tracks** is ~100 m and **the temporal resolution** is approximately 30 s. To discover the driving force behind different short-trip transportation patterns at both the individual and group level, land-use data and the locations of bus stops, road and bike lane networks, metro lines and stations **were all collected for the study area**. **Road network data were acquired from OpenStreetMap, while the rest of the data were crawled automatically from Gaode Map, similar to Google Map, in China**.
2. 方法描述部分
   - Based on the theory and method of complex graph theory, this study aims to describe the structure of the road network in Guangzhou quantitatively. We explore the community formed by the urban roads at different levels and identify the functional areas from a community perspective. This study can be divided into the following steps: 1. Establish an urban road network model using the processed OSM roads. 2. Divide the road network model into multilevel communities based on the Infomap method. 3. Depict the functional density, mixed and enrichment degree of each community with Gaode POIs. The flow chart of the study is shown in Figure 4.(From Yao yao, [https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806]('https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1584806'))
3. 结论描述/分析
   - (模型精度/预测结果)As we can see from the Fig. 6, high and reliable accuracy were achieved in predicting the six perceptual indicators.（全局总结） The accuracies of the different indicators varied. (不同指标的精度不同。表示差异的表述方式) For instance(举例说明), the accuracy of safe, beautiful, and wealth were slightly higher than that of depressing, boring and lively（举例结论一）. This result might be caused by variances in how people understand these concept（结论分析）; （进一步解释结论分析）their knowledge might tend to be relatively consistent with“what is the beautiful scene”but inconsistent with“what is the depressing scene”. Another reason might be insufficient data collection for the latter three dimensions（另一个结论分析）. In addition（此外）, the average accuracy decreased as the bandwidth of the sample gap narrowed (smallerδ)（举例结论二）, indicating that human preference was comparatively unstable for normal scenes.
